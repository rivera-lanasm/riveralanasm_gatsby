As algorithms and participatory technologies like social media platforms increasingly influence more aspects of society’s social and political functions, researchers seeking to understand and mitigate abuses using these technologies must consider these exploits as possibly features of the technologies themselves rather than outcomes of poorly implemented aspects of these technologies. This is the aim of sociotechnical systems studies, which demonstrates how technical infrastructure and social constructs–while traditionally imagined as largely separate–can constitute a system where powerful, self-reinforcing, and often unrecognized dynamics develop between previously disparate groups and entities (Goerzen, 2019). For researchers investigating online social phenomena like misinformation and hate speech, the lines of questioning emphasized by sociotechnical systems studies are important for understanding the patterns and targets of these phenomena.
